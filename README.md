## Stakeholders

Forrest's roommate Johan, an NYU Alum and avid weightlifter was interviewed for his perspective on this application.

### Johan's Goals/Needs/Desires for Caloric Tracking App

- Simple and quick input of calorie intake
- Ability to input and log common items / regular meals
- No advertisements
- Measurable goals and goal progress

### Johan's Problems/Frustrations with current solutions

- It is difficult to log your caloric intake outside of bloated software with unnecessary paid functionality
- Input forms ask for too much non-essential information
- Additional functionality of calorie trackers does not add value to the experience, instead it disincentivizes use
- Basic calorie trackers do too little, advanced trackers do too much of the wrong thing. A healthy medium with basic functionality and genuinely useful functionality would go a long way to help

## Product Vision Statement

FuelUp is a smart calorie tracking app that helps users monitor their daily intake while seamlessly integrating recipe recommendations, analytics-driven progress tracking using a calendar feature, and an article hub for nutritional insights and motivation.
